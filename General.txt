In classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the speed of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency 
f
{\displaystyle f} and emitted frequency 
f
0
{\displaystyle f_{\text{0}}} is given by:[8]
f
=
(
c
±
v
r
c
∓
v
s
)
f
0
{\displaystyle f=\left({\frac {c\pm v_{\text{r}}}{c\mp v_{\text{s}}}}\right)f_{0}}where

c
{\displaystyle c} is the propagation speed of waves in the medium;
v
r
{\displaystyle v_{\text{r}}} is the speed of the receiver relative to the medium. In the formula, 
v
r
{\displaystyle v_{\text{r}}} is added to 
c
{\displaystyle c} if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the receiver is moving away from the source;
v
s
{\displaystyle v_{\text{s}}} is the speed of the source relative to the medium. 
v
s
{\displaystyle v_{\text{s}}} is subtracted from 
c
{\displaystyle c} if the source is moving towards the receiver, added if the source is moving away from the receiver.
Note this relationship predicts that the frequency will decrease if either source or receiver is moving away from the other.

Equivalently, under the assumption that the source is either directly approaching or receding from the observer:
f
v

r
=
f
0
v
w
s
=
1
λ
{\displaystyle {\frac {f}{v_{wr}}}={\frac {f_{0}}{v_{ws}}}={\frac {1}{\lambda }}}where

v
w
r
{\displaystyle v_{wr}} is the wave's speed relative to the receiver;
v
w
s
{\displaystyle v_{ws}} is the wave's speed relative to the source;
λ
{\displaystyle \lambda } is the wavelength.
If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant speed), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.

If the speeds 
v
s
{\displaystyle v_{\text{s}}} and 
v
r
{\displaystyle v_{\text{r}}\,} are small compared to the speed of the wave, the relationship between observed frequency 
f
{\displaystyle f} and emitted frequency 
f
0
{\displaystyle f_{\text{0}}} is approximately[8]

{\displaystyle \Delta v=-(v_{\text{r}}-v_{\text{s}})} is the opposite of the relative speed of the receiver with respect to the source: it is positive when the source and the receiver are moving towards each other.
Proof
Given 
f
=
(
c
+
v
r
c
+
v
s
)
f
0
{\displaystyle f=\left({\frac {c+v_{\text{r}}}{c+v_{\text{s}}}}\right)f_{0}}

we divide for

{\displaystyle f=\left({\frac {1+{\frac {v_{\text{r}}}{c}}}{1+{\frac {v_{\text{s}}}{c}}}}\right)f_{0}=\left(1+{\frac {v_{\text{r}}}{c}}\right)\left({\frac {1}{1+{\frac {v_{\text{s}}}{c}}}}\right)f_{0}}

Since 
v
s
c
≪
1
{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{\text{s}}}{c}}\ll 1} we can substitute using the Taylor's series expansion of 
1

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1+{\frac {v_{\text{s}}}{c}}}}\approx 1-{\frac {v_{\text{s}}}{c}}}

For small

Stationary sound source produces sound waves at a constant frequency f, and the wave-fronts propagate symmetrically away from the source at a constant speed c. The distance between wave-fronts is the wavelength. All observers will hear the same frequency, which will be equal to the actual frequency of the source where f = f0.
